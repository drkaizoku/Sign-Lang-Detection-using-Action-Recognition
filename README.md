Language serves as a vital component of effective communication, encompassing written symbols, 
gestures, and vocalizations. Unfortunately, a significant disparity exists between sign language 
users and those who communicate through spoken languages. To bridge this gap, the objective of 
this research is to create a highly effective deep learning model that specializes in predicting British 
sign language. By minimizing this communication barrier, the model seeks to foster improved 
interaction between individuals with speech impairments and the wider community. In previous 
research, there was lack of text formation there were only isolated sign language detection whereas 
in this research sign language to text formation is achieved.
